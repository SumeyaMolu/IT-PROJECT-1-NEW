      <h1>About Our Website</h1>
      <p>
        We are a passionate team committed to empowering young women, especially those from marginalized communities,
        by bridging the opportunity gap through technology. Our platform provides access to mentorship, scholarships,
        leadership training, and job opportunities in a simple, accessible way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every girl deserves a fair chance to learn, grow, and lead. Whether from a rural village or urban town, we believe
        every young woman should have equal access to resources that help unlock her potential. Our digital platform is
        designed to break barriers, offering life-changing opportunities right at her fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collaborate with mentors, educational institutions, and organizations across Kenya and beyond to build a strong
        support system for girls and young women. Together, we aim to uplift, inform, and inspire the next generation of
        leaders who will create positive change in their communities.
